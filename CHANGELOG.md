## [Unreleased]

## [2026.5.6] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- **MITRE ATLAS taxonomy integration.** `ScannerIssue` gains optional `mitre_atlas` and `owasp_llm`
  fields. `RuleBasedScanner` wires these from YAML rule metadata. `reporter.py` adds URL builders
  and display-name lookups for both taxonomies. New `taxonomy_names.py` with human-readable names
  for all OWASP LLM Top 10 and MITRE ATLAS technique IDs.

- **Indirect prompt injection rules (MEDUSA-PIA-SCAN-101/102).** Two new detection rules with 50
  combined patterns for social authority injection and covert action concealment — attack patterns
  used by adversarial AI agents to manipulate other agents without triggering obvious injection
  keywords. Routed through `injection_payload_strings` category, firing ungated on all file types.

- **Supply chain import-pattern detection.** `critical_cve_scanner.py` now supports
  `import_patterns[]` in supply chain rule YAML. Detects malicious package names in manifest files
  (package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, Cargo.toml, pom.xml, etc.) without requiring CVE version
  matching. Rules with `fixed: none/n/a/unfixed` always fire. Covers npm, pypi, go, cargo, gem,
  maven ecosystems.

- **`--no-ai-safe` CLI flag.** Reports default to payload obfuscation (truncating/masking dangerous
  strings so the report itself cannot be used as a prompt injection vector). Pass `--no-ai-safe` to
  disable obfuscation and get verbatim findings in JSON/SARIF.

- **`garak` and `llm-guard` added to AI_TOOLS.** `medusa install --ai-tools` now installs garak
  (LLM red-teaming framework) and llm-guard (LLM output guard) in addition to modelscan.

### Fixed

- **FP over-suppression in repos with 'security' in the parent path.** `_check_security_module` was
  matching absolute paths, causing ALL findings in repos stored under `mcp-security/`, `IMCP/`, or
  any parent directory containing "security" to be suppressed.
  `mcp-exploit-demo`: 0 → 13 findings; `IMCP`: 0 → 80 findings.

- **Content-hash rule fingerprint.** Cache invalidation previously used `st_mtime` which is not
  preserved in CI, Docker layer restores, or artifact caches. Switched to SHA-256 of rule file
  content — correct in all environments (invalidates all caches on first upgrade run).

- **Silent file skip warnings.** Files exceeding the 2 MB scan limit or 50,000-line regex limit now
  emit a warning instead of silently returning a skipped-large-file result.

- **macOS/Windows spawn-mode cache loss.** Batch Trivy/Semgrep/GitLeaks caches are now snapshotted
  before the `multiprocessing.Pool` starts and injected via `Pool(initializer=...)`. Previously,
  spawn-mode workers (macOS 3.8+, Windows) started with empty caches, causing those tools'
  findings to be missing unless the slow per-file subprocess path succeeded.

- **`os.path.commonpath` HOME scan bug.** `find_scannable_files()` adds paths outside the project
  (e.g. `~/.cursor/mcp.json`); mixing those with project paths caused `commonpath()` to resolve to
  `$HOME`, triggering Trivy/Semgrep/GitLeaks to scan the entire home directory. Fixed to use
  `self.project_root` unconditionally.

- **IDE setup symlink race (L-2).** `_safe_open_write()` uses `O_NOFOLLOW` on POSIX so IDE config
  writes cannot be redirected via a pre-planted symlink.

- **`get_pip_command()` PATH shadowing.** pip binary is now resolved to an absolute path via
  `shutil.which()`, preventing user-writable PATH entries from shadowing the installer.

- **`git clone` PATH shadowing (ISSUE-004).** Git binary resolved to absolute path before cloning
  so a hostile package dropped earlier in PATH cannot intercept the operation.

- **Gradle lockfile CVE suppression.** `generated_code_marker` FP pattern now excludes
  `gradle.lockfile` — the file contains a `GENERATED FILE` banner but carries real Trivy CVE
  findings that must not be suppressed.

- **Test suite: 12 pre-existing test failures fixed.** All 391 tests now pass (previously 12
  failed due to stale mocks, removed CLI flags, wrong output path, and stale FP thresholds).

### Changed

- **`MultiAgentScanner` Pass 1 ungated scan.** `injection_payload_strings` category rules now fire
  before the compound gate (multi-agent keyword + framework indicator check), enabling detection
  of adversarial payload strings in any file type, not just files that pass the compound gate.

- **Regression test timing uses MEDUSA internal time.** `test_regression.py` now parses MEDUSA's
  own "Total time: X.Xs" from stdout (stable ~9s) rather than wall-clock time, which includes
  Semgrep/GitLeaks subprocess startup overhead that varies ~60-100s by environment.

## [2026.5.5] - 2026-04-18

### Security

Red-team review (2026-04-17) found 10 hardening opportunities across the
scanner pipeline. This release ships 8 of them; two findings (license key
crypto, IDE symlink race) are deferred to separate sprints. No CVEs are
disclosed against v2026.5.4 — these are defense-in-depth improvements.

- **C-1: Scanner argv injection defenses.** A malicious repo containing a
  file literally named `--config=https://evil.tld/rce.yaml` would previously
  have had the filename re-parsed as an option by semgrep and trivy, causing
  them to fetch attacker-controlled rule YAML from the network. Two fixes:
  (a) insert `--` separator before the trailing path positional in semgrep,
  trivy-config, and trivy-fs cmd lists; (b) new `BaseScanner._reject_if_dash_prefixed()`
  helper that short-circuits dash-prefixed basenames without invoking any
  external tool. GitLeaks uses `--source <value>` form and is safe-by-construction;
  the rejection helper still applies to it for defense-in-depth.

- **H-1 + M-2: Git URL SSRF defense.** `medusa scan --git <URL>` previously
  accepted any http(s)/ssh URL with no validation, enabling SSRF against
  loopback, RFC1918, link-local (AWS IMDS at 169.254.169.254), and internal
  DNS. Now validated in two layers: (a) default hostname allowlist of
  github.com, gitlab.com, bitbucket.org, codeberg.org plus their subdomains
  (exact or subdomain match; suffix attacks like `github.com.evil.tld`
  rejected); (b) DNS rebinding defense — every resolved IP is checked via
  `ipaddress.ip_address().is_private/is_loopback/is_link_local/is_reserved/is_multicast`
  and the URL is rejected if ANY resolved IP fails. New `--allow-any-host`
  flag on `medusa scan` opts out of the hostname allowlist; the private-IP
  check still applies regardless.

- **H-2a: File cache HMAC integrity.** `~/.medusa/cache/file_cache.json`
  previously loaded without integrity check, so an attacker with write
  access to a dev workstation or CI runner could forge cache entries
  marking vulnerable files clean, silently suppressing scan findings.
  Cache is now wrapped in `{"hmac": <hex>, "entries": {...}}` with a
  machine-local HMAC-SHA256 key at `~/.medusa/cache/.hmac_key` (mode 0600,
  generated on first run). Tampered, missing-HMAC (v5.4 upgrade), or
  corrupted caches are silently discarded and rebuilt from a fresh pass.
  Key rotation is `rm ~/.medusa/cache/.hmac_key`.

- **H-2b: Cached findings included in reports.** The report aggregation
  loop previously had `if not result.cached:` which silently dropped
  cached findings from the report entirely. A user hitting cache on a
  vulnerable file saw a clean report. Removed. Finding counts are now
  accurate on warm caches (total_lines_scanned under-counts but that's a
  cosmetic UX number).

- **M-1: Markdown report escape.** Source code containing triple-backticks
  (```) previously broke out of the code fence in generated markdown
  reports, allowing stored XSS / phishing payload delivery via GitHub /
  GitLab / any markdown renderer. New `_md_code_fence()` uses a fence one
  backtick longer than the longest run of consecutive backticks in the
  content, and `_md_sanitize_inline()` strips backticks/newlines from
  filenames before interpolation into inline spans.

- **L-1 + M-3: Dead HTML builder deletion.** Removed `_build_modern_findings_html`
  and `_build_findings_html` from `reporter.py` — both were dead code
  (unreachable from any live call path) AND both interpolated severity
  fields into `style="..."` attributes without html-escape. Deletion is
  the fix.

- **L-3: History file resilience.** `scan_history.json` load was previously
  unguarded; a corrupted file or injected JSON (from a world-writable
  reports dir) crashed the scan. Now wrapped in try/except with schema
  validation (list of dicts required), silent reset on malformed input.

### Testing

- New `tests/test_security_hardening.py` with 55 test cases covering
  every finding above: argv injection mocks, basename rejection, SSRF
  allowlist + DNS-rebind + escape-hatch, cache HMAC tamper + upgrade +
  rotation, markdown fence breakout payloads, history file corruption.
- Full suite: 378 pass + 55 new security tests, 11 pre-existing failures
  (test_simple_installer, test_git_scan, test_fp_regression) confirmed
  independent of this release.

### Deferred (tracked for future sprints)

- **C-2: License HMAC forgery.** `medusa/core/licensing.py` uses a keyless
  SHA-256 truncated to 16 hex chars as a "signature" — anyone can forge
  Professional or Enterprise license keys in three lines of Python.
  Requires Ed25519 migration + license server coordination. Tracking
  separately.
- **L-2: IDE setup symlink race.** `medusa/ide/claude_code.py` writes
  through symlinked `.claude/` paths. Local attacker only; defer to next
  minor release.

## [2026.5.4] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- **FP Patterns Migrated to YAML** - Moved 583 false positive patterns from `medusa/core/fp_patterns_db.py` (6,746 LOC Python) to per-scanner YAML files in `medusa/core/fp_patterns/` (27 files, one per scanner plus `_universal.yaml`).
  - New `load_known_fp_patterns()` loader in `fp_filter.py` with strict schema validation (`FPPatternSchemaError` on unknown keys, invalid `FPReason` enum values, or missing required fields).
  - Preserves deterministic load order: ASCII-sorted filenames, source order within each file.
  - Zero behavior change: `FalsePositiveFilter._FP_BY_SCANNER` bucket dict is byte-identical, regression benchmark findings unchanged (7 issues, 291 FPs filtered, 97.7% reduction).
- **Documentation** - Added `RULE_PROMOTION.md` documenting the repeatable workflow for promoting rules from `medusa-rules` → production, with smoke testing and benchmark validation against `medusa-test-targets/`.

### Removed

- **`medusa/core/fp_patterns_db.py`** - 6,746 LOC of hardcoded Python FP patterns. Data now lives in YAML; editing patterns no longer requires a code change.

### Net Impact

- **−2,815 LOC** repo-wide (−6,746 Python, +3,505 YAML, +141 loader)
- **FP patterns editable by non-Python contributors** via YAML
- **Pattern count now trivially countable** (`yq`, `grep`, etc.) — previously required AST parsing

## [2026.3.0.0] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

- **Scanner Attribution Bug** - Parallel scan findings were all attributed to the first scanner that processed each file. Fixed per-issue `_scanner_name` tracking in `parallel.py` so findings correctly report their originating scanner.
- **SteganographyScanner FPs** - Added compound gate requiring BOTH input handler indicators AND AI keyword indicators. Tightened role marker pattern to require line-start context. Eliminates FPs on files that merely mention AI terminology.
- **LLMGuardScanner FPs** - Toxicity check (LLG004) now requires actual LLM API call patterns (e.g., `chat.completions`, `messages.create`) before flagging missing toxicity checks. Output variable patterns narrowed to LLM-specific names.
- **MCPServerScanner FPs** - Tightened 3 patterns: time-based detection requires schema/tool context, `mcp-remote` requires dependency/config context, tool poisoning patterns require specific phrasing.
- **RAGSecurityScanner FPs** - HTTP source pattern narrowed from generic `source|url|path` to RAG-specific variable names (`source_url`, `document_path`, etc.). RAG poisoning pattern changed to space-only separator (won't match `rag_poisoning` variable names).
- **MultiAgentScanner FPs** - Added compound gate requiring BOTH multi-agent keywords AND actual framework imports/API calls (e.g., `from crewai import`, `Agent(`, `Crew(`). Prevents FPs on files that mention "crewai" or "agent-to-agent" in string literals or classification data.
- **Tool Poisoning Rule FPs** - Tightened patterns in `tool_attacks.yaml` and `mcp_vulnerabilities.yaml` to require specific context rather than broad substring matches.

### Changed

- **FP Filter Expanded** - 430 → 508 patterns (96.8% FP reduction rate on real-world projects)
  - 78 new patterns from scanner precision tuning and benchmark validation
- **Compound Scanner Gates** - SteganographyScanner, LLMGuardScanner, and MultiAgentScanner now use compound gates that require both keyword presence AND framework-specific imports/API calls
- **Self-Scan Baseline** - 115 → 114 findings (YAMLScanner removal)

### Removed

- **YAMLScanner (yamllint)** - Removed yamllint integration. It produced only style lint (indentation, missing `---`), not security findings. YAML security is fully covered by Trivy, Semgrep, and MEDUSA's own built-in rules. Scanner types reduced from 42 to 41.

## [2026.2.4] - 2026-02-15

### Performance

- **52% Scan Time Reduction** - Comprehensive performance overhaul on MEDUSA's own codebase (17.1s → 8.2s)
- **12.7% Faster on Large Projects** - Real-world benchmark on 4,124-file project (13,711s → 11,976s)
- **Single-Pass File Discovery** - Replaced 57 separate `rglob()` calls with one `os.walk()` traversal, pre-compiling exclusion patterns to a single regex
- **Scanner Pre-Mapping Cache** - First 8KB of each file read once and shared across all scanners, eliminating redundant file I/O during confidence scoring
- **FP Filter Pre-Compilation** - 7 hot-path regex patterns compiled at class level instead of per-finding
- **OWASP Scanner Pattern Hoisting** - 10 `re.compile()` calls moved from per-line loop to class-level constants
- **Live Table Responsiveness** - Capped multiprocessing pool chunksize at 8 to prevent batched results freezing the progress display on large projects

### Changed

- **Structural Refactoring** - Major code quality improvements:
  - `mcp_config_scanner.py`: Split 335-line god method (CC=98) into 7 focused sub-methods
  - `cli.py`: Split `init()` (CC=91) into 4 functions, replaced 5 IDE copy-paste branches with data-driven loop
  - `fp_filter.py`: Extracted 4,684 lines of pattern data to `fp_patterns_db.py`, reducing filter logic to 675 lines
  - `parallel.py`: Removed 189 lines of dead code, consolidated stats accumulation (5x dedup)
  - `reporter.py`: Removed dead code (`parse_bandit_json`, legacy `main()`), pre-compiled SARIF regex patterns
- **FP Filter Expanded** - 425 → 430 patterns (93.9% FP reduction rate, up from 93.3%)
  - 5 new patterns from OpenClaw benchmark: chat extension toxicity checks, import-line LLM API calls, Graph API type definitions, documentation placeholder IDs, system prompt security boundaries
- **Config Dataclass** - Added missing `ide_openai_enabled` and `ide_copilot_enabled` fields (P0 bug fix)

### Fixed

- **Live Progress Table Freezing** - On projects with 4,000+ files, the progress table appeared frozen because multiprocessing pool chunksize grew to 179. Now capped at 8 for smooth updates.
- **Config P0 Bug** - `MedusaConfig.from_dict()` crashed on configs with OpenAI Codex or GitHub Copilot IDE settings
- **Dead Code Removal** - Removed unused `_scan_with_bandit()`, `_scan_with_medusa()`, legacy `main()` functions, and unreachable imports across 6 modules

### Added
- **React2Shell CVE Detection** - Merged React2ShellScanner into CriticalCVEScanner with 10 new CVE entries (CCVE-124 to CCVE-133) covering CVE-2025-55182 (React Server Components RCE) and CVE-2025-66478 (Next.js RCE) across all affected version ranges

- **Progress Table Rendering** - Fixed Rich Live table printing dozens of times on macOS by using stderr and TTY detection

### Fixed
- **FP Filter Test File Regex** - Fixed `test[s]?[/_]` matching `medusa-test/` directory path, suppressing all findings in test scan directories
- **Cache Error Noise** - Silenced `[Errno 2]` cache update errors when directories are deleted during scan
- **Version Strings** - Updated all hardcoded `v2026.2` references to `v2026.2.1` across CLI, README, and docs

### Removed
- **React2ShellScanner** - Standalone scanner deleted; all React/Next.js CVE detection now handled by CriticalCVEScanner via the curated YAML database

- Scanner count increased from 75 to 77

### Changed
- **Simplified Installation**: MEDUSA now only manages `modelscan` via `medusa install --ai-tools`
- **AI Rules First**: 3,200+ AI security detection patterns work out of the box
- **External Linters Optional**: Auto-detected if present, not installed by MEDUSA
- **CLI Cleanup**: Removed 1,500+ lines of legacy installer code

### Fixed
- **CLI Skip Display** - "Skipped (not needed): 34" now shows which languages are absent (e.g., "34 scanners skipped (no Go, Ruby, PHP, Rust files found)")
- **HTML Linter Banner** - "36 External Linters Not Installed" now only shows linters relevant to detected project languages
